# EIP-712 Onboarding 
In this demo users are identified with either their Twitter, Github or Reddit accounts via Keybase and 
are onboarded (by sending 10 ETH) to a private Ethereum chain.   
The project is based on the corresponsing blog post.  
The project is solely for training purposes, do not use any part in production environments!

## Original EIP712 Signing Demo

This is derived from the demonstration of EIP712 signing support (EIP712 Signing Demo) via MetaMask's `eth_signTypedData_v3` API call.

[Try the original version here.](https://weijiekoh.github.io/eip712-signing-demo/index.html)

You need a version of MetaMask that supports `eth_signTypedData_v3` to use this demo (4.14+).

## Aragon and Keybase

As mentioned in the corresponding blogpost, the original idea is based on blog posts by Aragon and on functionality provided by keybase.io.
